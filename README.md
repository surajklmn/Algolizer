# Algolizer

Algolizer is a C++ project designed to visualize data structures and algorithms. Using the powerful graphics library Raylib, Algolizer provides an intuitive and interactive way to understand the inner workings of various algorithms and data structures.

## Features

- Visualization of common data structures (e.g., arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs).
- Step-by-step visualization of algorithms (e.g., sorting algorithms, search algorithms).
- Interactive interface to manipulate and observe changes in real-time.

## Dependencies

To run Algolizer, you will need the following dependencies installed on your system:

- CMake
- GCC or G++
- Raylib

## Building and Running Algolizer

Follow these steps to build and run Algolizer:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/surajklmn/Algolizer.git
    cd Algolizer
    ```

2. Create a build directory and generate the build files using CMake:
    ```sh
    cmake -B build
    ```

3. Change to the build directory:
    ```sh
    cd build
    ```

4. Compile the project using Make:
    ```sh
    make
    ```

5. Run Algolizer:
    ```sh
    ./Algolizer
    ```

## Usage

Upon running Algolizer, you will be presented with a graphical interface where you can choose different data structures and algorithms to visualize. You can interact with the visualizations to gain a better understanding of how the algorithms work and how data structures are manipulated.
